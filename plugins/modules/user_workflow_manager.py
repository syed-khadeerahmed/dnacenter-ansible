      Example: Creating a Custom Role Configuration with mixed Permission under different main parameters:
    Description: This configuration creates a custom role with specific permissions tailored for various modules in the Cisco Catalyst Center. 
                 It allows Write permissions for Advanced Network Settings, Image Repository, Network Hierarchy, and Network Profiles under Network Design. 
                 It also provides Read permissions for Device Configuration and Network Device under Inventory Management within Network Provision, 
                 while denying access (Deny) to all other parameters across different modules.
    config:
    create_new_custom_role:

        Monitoring_Settings: "Deny"

    Explanation: This playbook configuration defines a custom role with specific access permissions for different modules in Cisco Catalyst Center. It ensures that the custom 
                 role has write permissions (Write) for Advanced Network Settings, Image Repository, Network Hierarchy, and Network Profiles under Network Design. It also grants 
                 read permissions (Read) for Device Configuration and Network Device under Inventory Management within Network Provision. All other parameters across Assurance, 
                 Network Analytics, Network Services, Platform, Security, System, and Utilities are denied access (Deny), aligning with security policies and specific role 
                 requirements in your environment. Adjust the permissions as needed based on your organization's security and operational needs.

  For Role Create or Update for each main-param:
  # Top-level configuration for custom role permissions.
  description: User must select any one of the options "Deny or Read or Write" for each parameter.
  type: str
  create_new_custom_role:
    Assurance: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for Assurance module.
    Network_Analytics: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for Network Analytics module.
    Network_Design: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for Network Design module.
    Network_Provision: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for Network Provision module.
    Network_Services: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for Network Services module.
    Platform: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for Platform module.
    Security: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for Security module.
    System: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for System module.
    Utilities: "Deny/Read/Write"  # Permissions for Utilities module.

    Example 1: Creating a Custom Role for Network Design
    Description: If you want to grant, write permissions for a custom role, you need to specify "Write" for Network Design and "Deny" for all other parameters.
                 The example below grants write permission only for Network Design.
    config:
    create_new_custom_role:
      - Assurance: “Deny” 
        Network_Analytics: "Deny "
        Network_Design: "Write "
        Network_Provision: "Deny "
        Network_Services: "Deny "
        Platform: "Deny "
        Security: "Deny "
        System: "Deny "
        Utilities: "Deny "
    The above configuration ensures that the custom role has write permissions exclusively for Network Design, while denying write permissions for all other parameters.

    Example 2: Creating a Custom Role with Mixed Permissions
    Description: This example demonstrates how to configure a custom role with specific permissions for various parameters. It grants write permission for Network Design, 
                 read permission for Network Analytics, and denies access for all other parameters.
    config:
    create_new_custom_role:
    - Assurance: "Deny"
      Network_Analytics: "Read"
      Network_Design: "Write"
      Network_Provision: "Deny"
      Network_Services: "Deny"
      Platform: "Deny"
      Security: "Deny"
      System: "Deny"
      Utilities: "Deny"
    In the above configuration:
    Network_Analytics: Read access (Read)
    Network_Design: Write access (Write)
    Assurance,Network_Provision, Network_Services, Platform, Security, System, Utilities: All denied access (Deny)
    Adjust the permissions (Write, Read, or Deny) as per your specific role requirements for each parameter

    delete_role:
    username:
      description: The rolename in the Cisco Catalyst Center to be deleted.
      type: str
      required: true
    
requirements:
  - dnacentersdk >= V2_3_7_6
  - python >= 3.9
